Create a synthetic multivariate time series data of at least 1 GB using the following code. And apply any simple anomaly detection algorithms and display the results like shown in the pdf doc attached.  Please share the dataset link. 
Introduction
"We generated synthetic multivariate time-series data with a size exceeding 1 GB. Anomalies were introduced in attributes such as CPU temperature, memory usage, and CPU usage."

Dataset Description
Include:

Number of rows and columns.
Key columns analyzed (cpu_temperature, cpu_usage, etc.).
Methodology
Explain:

Z-Score method applied for anomaly detection.
Threshold for anomalies: Z > 3 or Z < -3.
Results
Total anomalies detected.
Charts showing anomalies.
